## Writing Effective Prompts

<!-- s7 -->
### The Importance of Specific Conditions

<!-- s8 -->
Writing prompts (instruction text) is crucial for generating high-quality materials from ChatGPT. Vague instructions won't yield desired results. Be sure to include these essential elements:

<!-- s9 -->
- **Learner Level**: Beginning (N5 level), Upper Intermediate (N2 level), etc.
<!-- s10 -->
- **Material Type**: Reading comprehension, grammar exercises, conversation practice, etc.
<!-- s11 -->
- **Learning Objectives**: Grammar points to master, vocabulary count, skills to develop, etc.
<!-- s12 -->
- **Volume**: Number of questions, character count, time required, etc.
<!-- s13 -->
- **Format**: Multiple choice, written answers, role-play, etc.

<!-- s14 -->
### Staged Prompt Design

<!-- s15 -->
Rather than seeking perfect materials in one go, it's more effective to improve them gradually through stages.
