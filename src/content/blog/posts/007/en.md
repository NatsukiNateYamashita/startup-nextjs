## Writing Effective Prompts

### The Importance of Specific Conditions

Writing prompts (instruction text) is crucial for generating high-quality materials from ChatGPT. Vague instructions won't yield desired results. Be sure to include these essential elements:

- **Learner Level**: Beginning (N5 level), Upper Intermediate (N2 level), etc.
- **Material Type**: Reading comprehension, grammar exercises, conversation practice, etc.
- **Learning Objectives**: Grammar points to master, vocabulary count, skills to develop, etc.
- **Volume**: Number of questions, character count, time required, etc.
- **Format**: Multiple choice, written answers, role-play, etc.

### Staged Prompt Design

Rather than seeking perfect materials in one go, it's more effective to improve them gradually through stages.
