# The Frontier of Japanese Language Education with AI: A New Relationship Between Teachers and Learners

## Introduction

In the field of Japanese language education, rapidly evolving AI technologies are drawing increasing attention. Tools like generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT), speech recognition apps, and translation software are transforming the way we learn and teach.

This article explores how AI can be integrated into Japanese language education, showcasing practical examples and examining how the teacher-learner relationship is changing.

## Current State of AI in Japanese Language Education

AI is already being used in various aspects of Japanese education:
- Machine translation (e.g., DeepL, Google Translate)
- Speech recognition (e.g., YouGlish, Elsa Speak)
- Essay correction and conversation practice (e.g., ChatGPT)

These tools allow learners to practice anytime, enabling autonomous learning. For teachers, they reduce repetitive workloads and allow more time for creative, in-depth instruction.

## Practical Examples of Conversation Practice with ChatGPT

ChatGPT is an excellent virtual conversation partner.

### Example of Conversation Practice
**Learner's Goal: Learn natural expressions for daily conversation**
- Input “I want to practice a conversation at a café” into ChatGPT for role-playing practice.
- If incorrect expressions are used, ChatGPT provides gentle corrections and explanations.

### Essay Correction is Also Possible
If a learner submits a written text:
- ChatGPT points out vocabulary and grammar errors
- Suggests more natural expressions
- Offers corrections with explanations

## Using AI Translators and Dictionary Apps

### DeepL vs Google Translate Comparison
| Feature       | DeepL            | Google Translate     |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Naturalness| ◎                | ○                    |
| Technical Terminology | ○       | ◎                    |
| Editability| ◎ (easy to revise) | △                   |

Teachers can use these translation apps to check learners’ compositions or assist in translating specialized documents. However, it's crucial not to accept translations as final answers but to analyze *why* they were translated that way.

## How the Role of Teachers Is Changing

With the rise of AI, teachers are transitioning from being "information providers" to "learning facilitators."

### Traditional Teacher Roles
- Provide correct answers
- Assign exercises

### Emerging Teacher Roles
- Introduce tools suited to each learner
- Curate learning content and give feedback
- Teach context and culture that AI cannot capture

## The Human Element Still Matters in the AI Era

Some areas can't be fully taught by AI:

- Subtle nuances in levels of politeness (keigo)
- Choosing appropriate words based on facial expressions or context
- Explaining cultural background (e.g., the meaning of “Itadakimasu”)

This is where Japanese teachers truly shine. Providing instruction with context and empathy—something AI lacks—resonates with learners.

## Comparing AI Use in Classroom vs Online

| Use Case      | In-Class Learning     | Online Learning          |
|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Speech Recognition | ◎ (ideal for pronunciation) | ◎ (combined with apps)   |
| Essay Correction   | △ (paper-based)         | ◎ (real-time correction) |
| Translation Tools  | ○ (as support tools)    | ◎ (instant checking)     |

Online environments are particularly well-suited for integrating multiple tools and supporting individualized learning.

## Practical Advice and Recommended Tools

### Recommended Tools for New Teachers
- **ChatGPT**: Essay correction, conversation practice, grammar Q&A
- **Elsa Speak**: Pronunciation training and feedback
- **YouGlish**: Check real-world usage of vocabulary via videos
- **DeepL**: Natural translation and rewriting assistance

### Tips for Effective Use
- Treat translation tools as comparison references, not absolute answers
- Give clear prompts to ChatGPT (e.g., “Write a reply in business Japanese”)
- Teach learners how to use tools responsibly (avoid copy-paste abuse)

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

AI is significantly transforming Japanese language education—but human instruction remains indispensable. By collaborating with AI, teachers can provide richer and more flexible learning experiences.

Understanding how to properly use AI tools and positioning ourselves as learning guides will be crucial in the next era of Japanese language education.

AI technologies will continue to evolve. As Japanese language educators, let’s keep learning and build the future of education together with AI.
