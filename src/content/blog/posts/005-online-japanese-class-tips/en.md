# 5 Keys to Successful Online Japanese Lessons: Creating Learning That Rivals In-Person Classes

<!-- s2 -->
## Introduction

<!-- s3 -->
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, online education has rapidly expanded worldwide, and online Japanese lessons have become increasingly common. However, many teachers still face challenges such as unclear learner responses, lack of natural interaction, and difficulty using teaching materials effectively.

<!-- s4 -->
This article shares 5 practical tips for Japanese teachers venturing into online classes, along with useful tools and examples. You'll find plenty of insights on how to make your classes not just comparable to in-person lessons, but even more effective thanks to the unique benefits of online learning.

<!-- s5 -->
## Advantages and Challenges of Online Classes

<!-- s6 -->
### Advantages
- No geographic limits: connect with learners worldwide  
- Easy recording and review: lessons can be replayed  
- Effortless material sharing: PDFs, videos, Google Drive, etc.  

<!-- s7 -->
### Challenges
- Harder to grasp the pace of conversation  
- Maintaining learner focus is difficult  
- Technical issues (Wi-Fi, mic, screen sharing)

<!-- s8 -->
Unlike in-person classes, online lessons require different preparation and classroom flow. Advance planning and flexibility are key.

<!-- s9 -->
## Basic Steps for Designing Online Lessons

<!-- s10 -->
### 1. Clarify the Purpose and Goals  
<!-- s11 -->
Break down lesson content into clear objectives like “vocabulary introduction,” “grammar practice,” or “speaking fluency.” Clear goals help you choose tools and design activities effectively.

<!-- s12 -->
### 2. Plan Time Allocation Wisely  
<!-- s13 -->
Since online learners tend to lose focus faster, aim for 15–20 minute segments such as “explanation → practice → sharing.”

<!-- s14 -->
### 3. Incorporate Interactive Activities  
<!-- s15 -->
Regularly involve learners in speaking or operating tools. Use breakout rooms or polling features to keep engagement high.

<!-- s16 -->
## 5 Free Tools You Should Be Using

<!-- s17 -->
### 1. Zoom (The Gold Standard for Video Conferencing)  
- Use breakout rooms for small group conversation practice  
- Use the whiteboard to write in real-time

<!-- s18 -->
### 2. Google Jamboard  
- Useful for organizing grammar patterns or mapping vocabulary  
- Check understanding using stamps or sticky notes  

<!-- s19 -->

<!-- s20 -->
### 3. Mentimeter  
- Conduct polls, quizzes, and idea sharing in real time  
- Great for engaging silent students

<!-- s21 -->
### 4. Padlet  
- Use it as a virtual bulletin board or sharing platform  
- Learners can post text, images, or links

<!-- s22 -->
### 5. ChatGPT  
- Helps with conversation practice and essay correction  
- Excellent for self-study beyond class hours

<!-- s23 -->
## Techniques to Maintain Learner Focus

<!-- s24 -->
### Add Movement to Your Slides  
<!-- s25 -->
Use animations or transitions to prevent visual monotony.

<!-- s26 -->
### Insert Mini Quizzes  
<!-- s27 -->
Grammar quizzes via Zoom’s chat feature create a sense of urgency and engagement.

<!-- s28 -->
### Call Learners by Name  
<!-- s29 -->
Prompt participation by saying things like “What do you think, Yamada-san?”

<!-- s30 -->
## Quick-Response Manual for Common Troubles

<!-- s31 -->
### Typical Issues and Solutions  
<!-- s32 -->
- **No audio**: Check mic/speaker settings; guide via chat  
<!-- s33 -->
- **Screen sharing won’t work**: Share file links in advance  
<!-- s34 -->
- **Unstable internet**: Follow up with recordings or shared slides

<!-- s35 -->
### 3 Habits to Prepare for Trouble  
<!-- s36 -->
1. Test all functions (camera, screen share, recording) 10 minutes before class  
2. Store backup materials on Google Drive  
3. Log in with a second device like a phone or tablet

<!-- s37 -->
## In-Person vs Online Classes: Differences and Synergy

<!-- s38 -->
Online classes can’t fully convey non-verbal cues or spontaneous interaction. But they offer unique strengths such as:
- Chat-based follow-up explanations  
- Recordings for later review  
- Integration with self-paced learning  

<!-- s39 -->
Rather than seeing online and in-person as opposites, aim to combine both depending on the objective.

<!-- s40 -->
## Success Case: Kotoba Academy’s Online Strategy

<!-- s41 -->
Kotoba Academy in Tokyo runs online classes twice a week with the following structure:
- First 20 mins: Grammar introduction via Zoom (slides + oral practice)  
- Middle 20 mins: Breakout room conversation practice  
- Final 20 mins: Essay sharing and feedback using Jamboard

<!-- s42 -->
They also use Padlet for sharing learning logs and ChatGPT for homework support. In a satisfaction survey, 85% of students said the online classes were as good as—or better than—in-person ones.
