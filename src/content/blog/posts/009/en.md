# How to Build a Japanese Pronunciation Practice App Using Speech Recognition AI

## Introduction

Mastering pronunciation is one of the major challenges for Japanese language learners. In particular, accurately acquiring subtle sound differences and intonation patterns in Japanese has been difficult with traditional learning materials alone. However, with the advancement of speech recognition AI technology, high-precision pronunciation practice has become possible even for individual learners.

This article provides a detailed explanation of how to develop a Japanese pronunciation practice app using speech recognition AI, from technology selection to implementation. We offer a practical development guide for EdTech startup developers and technical professionals interested in language learning applications.

## Speech Recognition API Selection and Comparison

### Features of Major Speech Recognition Services

When selecting a speech recognition API suitable for a Japanese pronunciation practice app, consider the following factors:

**Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**
- High accuracy in Japanese recognition with real-time processing capability
- Detailed recognition results available at the phoneme level
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model for easy scaling
- Provides confidence scores and timestamp information

**Microsoft Azure Speech Services**
- Built-in Pronunciation Assessment feature
- Detailed evaluation scores at phoneme, word, and sentence levels
- Support for Japanese dialects and accents
- Rich developer SDK

**Amazon Transcribe**
- Easy integration with AWS ecosystem
- Custom vocabulary feature for specialized terminology
- Speaker identification capability
- Relatively good cost-performance ratio

### Technical Considerations for Implementation

When selecting a speech recognition API, verify that it meets the following technical requirements:

```javascript
// Basic implementation example of speech recognition API (Web Speech API + Google Cloud Speech)
class VoiceRecognitionService {
  constructor(apiKey) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.recognition = null;
    this.isRecording = false;
  }

  async startRecognition(targetText) {
    if (!this.recognition) {
      this.recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
      this.recognition.lang = 'ja-JP';
      this.recognition.continuous = false;
      this.recognition.interimResults = true;
    }

    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      this.recognition.onresult = (event) => {
        const result = event.results[0][0].transcript;
        this.evaluatePronunciation(result, targetText)
          .then(resolve)
          .catch(reject);
      };

      this.recognition.start();
    });
  }
}
```

## Designing the Pronunciation Evaluation Algorithm

### Phoneme-Level Evaluation Methods

Precise analysis at the phoneme level is crucial for Japanese pronunciation evaluation. An effective evaluation system can be built by combining the following approaches:

**Phoneme Matching Evaluation**
Calculate the matching degree between recognized and correct phonemes. Special handling is required for Japanese-specific phonemes (such as ん, っ, ー).

```python
def evaluate_phoneme_accuracy(recognized_phonemes, target_phonemes):
    """
    Evaluate pronunciation accuracy at phoneme level
    """
    alignment = align_phonemes(recognized_phonemes, target_phonemes)
    
    correct_count = 0
    total_count = len(target_phonemes)
    
    for target, recognized in alignment:
        if target == recognized:
            correct_count += 1
        elif is_similar_phoneme(target, recognized):
            correct_count += 0.5  # Award partial points
    
    return correct_count / total_count
```
